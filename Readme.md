# super-duper-serial-gps-system

## IMPORTANT NOTE

This module is now deprecated and it is no longer maintained.  Use [GPS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gps)
([github](https://github.com/infusion/GPS.js)) instead.  The GPS module has all the functionality of this module and
more.  It supports many more NMEA commands. Migration should be trivial.

## The code remains

The code remains, but I recommend any suggestions and changes to be contributed to the GPS module mentioned above.
